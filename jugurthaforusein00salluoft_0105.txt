NOTES. 97

4. Incorruptus] i. e. qui corrumpi nequit. Tac. nist.
i. 35, Galba minantibus intrepidus, adversus blandientes incor-

ruptus 3 with the force of arn adj. in -bilis.

5. corporis gaudiis] Cicero, de Fen. ii. 4, restricts qau-
dium to mental pleasures, while voluptas, he says, may be
used either of mind or body. But as Epicurus affirmed, that
even the pleasures of the body were really referable to mental
perceptione, he allows that, in this sense, the body can be said
qaudere. Tusc. v, 33.

l t6. Artes animi] “Occupations which exercise the intel-
ec .”

CHAPTER ΙΙΙ.
1. ΣΙ his] ‘⁴ Of these occupations.”

2. mag-istratus et imperia] Those who held manis-iratus.
scil. dictatore„ consuls, praetors, censorS‚ dcc„ elected by the
people at the comitia centuriata, had civil imperium of various
kinds in the city, and were said in imperio esse ; when any
such officers went into the province& they exercised military
imperium through a lez curiata, and were then said cum ἰηι-

perio esse.

3. Honos] In its technical sense, ‘⁴ civic distincti0n‚'' i. q.
ἒοπονεε. Liv, xlii. 22, quo die novi magistratus inituri erant
onorem.

4. 18 tuit] Scil. is honos. So Kritz reads, on the author-
ity of several MSS. The more common reading is jus or vis,
neither of which words gives a satisfactory sense.

5. Utique] So the MSS. generally, but omitted in most
editions: the word implies Jbrsuoffl, or, as they think.

6. Patriam aut parentes] Comp. Catil. 6, patriam pa-
rentesque armis tegere. J uslur. 87, annis patriam parentesque
tegi, where parentes can only mean parents, or generally rela-
cives. But parentes is used sometimes for subjects, i. q. obedi-
entes : as Jugy. 102, parentes abunde habemus, amicorum nun·
quam satis fuit. Here the disjunctive aut marks an opposition
1101νὶ0011 the two objects, and parentes may best be construed
“su jecta!

7. Importunum est] “ Is inconvenient‚ injuriousJ’
However much the usurpet may employ his power to reform
abuses‚ still the revolution by which he has risen will engender
worse evils. These remarks are supposed to point to the usur-
pation or Caesar, or of 1110 second Triumvirate.
