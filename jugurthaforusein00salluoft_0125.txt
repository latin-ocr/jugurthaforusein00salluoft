‘⁴ otherwise than.’' Juyur. 100, neque secus atque in mari.

jam spe et opinione praedam illam devorasset. Ad Ait. i. 16,
1116 autem regis haereditatem spe devoraverat.

6. Praedas] This word is used ‘m the plur. in Juqur. 32,
41, 44. Booty may be of various kinds, or carried off by
various personS, or from various places.

CHAPTER XXI.

1. Obvius procedit] For the use of the adjective instead
of the adverb obviam, comp. diversus, Juqur. 12, 46, 50, and
the phrases certantes agere, Juyur. 44, frequentes incederert,
Juyur. 46, festinare pergit, Jusyur. 52, properantes arma ca-
piunt, Juyur. 53, occultus veniat, Juyur. 61, quo improvisus
gravior accederet, Juyur. 88, citi sese ostendunt, Juyur. 101.

2. Cirtam] Cirta, Gr. Κίρτα, apparently i. q. the Phoe-
nician Kartha, “a city;’' called afterwards by the Romans
Sittianorum colonia, from the followers of P. Sittius, a Roman
adventurer who assisted Caesar in his African campaign;
known in modern times by the name of Constantineh. It lies
about 40 miles inland, on the river Ampsagas, and was one of
the principal cities of Numidia.

3. Die] An old form of the gen. Virg. Geo. i. Libra die
somnique pares ubi fecerit horas. This form is preserved 'ny
the MSS. in several places in Sallust, ag. Juyur. 52, 97,
though here many read diei.

4. Plerumque noctis processit] Comp. Juyur. 51, multum

say, “with the fourth sun,'' i.e. on the fourth day.
