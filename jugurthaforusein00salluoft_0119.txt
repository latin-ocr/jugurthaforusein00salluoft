4. Contemnere] “ Express their contempt for.” So Cic.
pro Mur. 7, contempsisti Murenae genuS, extulisti tuum.

5. Bonum et aequum] Bonum, that which is good in
itself ε aequum that which may be required of one.

“ 6. Aemilius Scaurus] There were several families belong-
ing to the Aemilian gens, distinguished by the surnames Lepi-
dus, Paullus, Scaurus, dcc. Scaurus signifies a person with
crooked or weak ancles. Hor. Sat. i. 3. 47, scaurum pravis
fultum male talis. The greatest man of this family was the
M. Scaurus here mentioned. He was consul B.c. 1153 tri-
umphed over the Ligures, and made the Aemilian YVay from
Pisae to Lunae and thence to Dertona. Strab. V. He was
consul B.c. 107, censor, and afterwards princeps senatus. He
was a staunch champion of the senate3 nevertheless he was
accused by Varius, a tribune of the people, of exciting the
Italians to revolt, 13.c. 90. Scaurus proudly demanded of the
people whether they would take the word of Varius, a Spani-
ard, or of Scaurus, the prince of the senate3 and this appeal
was answered with acclamations. Cicero extols the character
of Scaurus as a champion of the nobility. For the same rea-
son probably Sallust seeks to depreciate him.

7. Polluta] “ Shameless;” “detestable.’' Juq. 53, indig-
nus honore et quasi pollutus

CHAPTER XVI.

2. L. Opimius] A champion of the optimates, and vehe-
ment opponent of theAgrarian laws of the Gracchi. He was
consul B.c. 121, in which capacity the senate called upon him
to see “ne quid res publica detrimenti caperet.’' This decree
was called Senatus-consultum ultimum, and was interpreted
by the nobles as investing the consul with plenary authority
over the lives of the citizens. Accordingly Opimius caused
G. Gracchus, and his colleague in the tribunate, Fulvius F lac-
cuS‚ to be seized‚ as public enemies, and put to death. The
plebs denied the right to put any citizen to death except by a
vote of the people. Opimius was eventually condemned by a
popular vote for taking bribes of Jugurtha, and driven into

bauffihment. Cicero extols him as the saviour of the common-
wea .

3. Victoriam] Opimius followed up the slaughter of Grac-
chus by the massacre of three thousand of his pai-tizans in the
city. Plut. C. Gracch. Victoriam exercere is to exercise the
rights of victory. So in Catil. 38.
