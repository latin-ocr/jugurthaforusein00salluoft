and hesitation of his counsels. Comp. the shades of meaning
in the word in c. 92 and again in 98.

2. Nullo impedimento] Priscian, vi. 7. 36, vetustissimi
solent omnium in -z‘us terminantium genitivum, etiam in —i
genitivum et in -Q dativum proferre. Cic. pro Mur. 12 (if the
reading is correct), ei quoque carmen compositum est, quum
ceteris rebus absurdum, tum vero nullo usui utrisque. Caes.
B. C. ii. 7, nullo usui. B. G. vi. 13, nullo concilio adhibetur.
But it may be the ablative in this place, as in Cic. ad Att. x,
18, majore impedimento fuerunt.’'

3. Simul—et] “ No sooner—than.'' Comp. Tac. Ann. iv.
25, simul coeptus dies, et aderant in semisomnos.

4. Aut instrui aut. sarcinas comgere] “Before the army
was arrayed for fighting, or had (even) put the baggage toge-
ther’' (as usual before action). Sarcina, the soldier's pack or
bundle: Juvenal, ii. 103, speculum civilis sarcina belli.

5. Latrocinio proelio] This opposition is frequently
employed. Comp. Liv. xxiX. 6, latrociniis magis quam justo
bello gerebatur res. Cic, in Catil. i. 10.

6. Veteres (novique)] The last word should be put in
brackets as suspicions, though found in all the MSS„ except
one. It is explained, “the Romans being veterans and meruits,
and on that account skilful in warfare‚'’ i.e. because they were
not all recruits. Sallust had used a similar combination, ch.
87, sic brevi spatio novi veteresque coaluere, et virtus omnium

:aequalis facta: from which novique may have been foisted into
1s passage.

CHAPTER XCVIII.

1. Manu consulere, etc.] “Since he could not aid his
men as a general by giving orders, he aided them as a private
soldier, by taking part in the combat personally.” So ante

ch. ῗ9, armatus dedecore potius quam manu salutem quaesi·
vera .

2. Pro se] “In their own favour!

3. Ex copia rerum consilium trahit] “Drawn out his
plans from the various resources before him;’' implying diffi-
culty of choice rather than hesitation.

4. Neque minus] i. q. non minus: neque properly is equi-
valent to et non ; but the copula is out of place here.
