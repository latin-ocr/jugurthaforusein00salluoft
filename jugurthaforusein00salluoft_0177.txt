1. Quos] Referring to equites, understood in equitatus.

2. Ex Latio] i.e. from the socii Latini nominis, such Ita-
lian towns as had the Latin franchise.

3. 1.. Sisenna] This historian. one of the Cornelian genS,
and partial perhaps on that account to Sulla, wrote a history
of the social war and the civil wars of Sulla and Marius. He
was born about 118 Β.0., and was praetor in 78, the year in
which Sulla died. Cicero speaks of him. de Les). i. 2, Brut. 76,
and esteemed him superior as an historian to his predecessors.
About 150 fragments of his great work are preserved, but very
short and unconnected.

4. Familia. prope jam extincta] So Velleffls, 11. 17, says
of him3 L. Corn. Sulla natus familia 11011111, sextus a Cornelio
Rufino, qui 110110 Pyrrhi inter celeberrimos fuerat duces, quum
familiae ejus claritudo intermissa esset, diu ita se gessit, ut
nullam petendi consulatum cogitationem habere videretur.
Sallust speaks of the familia of the Sullae, a branch of the
Rufini. The Cornelii were a numerous and distinguished
90713 111 early times, and were subdivided into several sami liae,
eg. patrician: Arvina, Blasio, Cethegus, Cinna, Cossus, Dola-
bella, Lentulus, Maluginensis, Mammula, Merenda, Merula,
Rufinus, Scapula. Scipio, Sisenna, Sulla. Of these the Len-
tuli and Scipios had various aynomens, distinguishing indivi-
duals. The plebeian Cornelii were Galli and Balbi. Sulla
introduced a vast number of his own clients and dependents
into the Cornelian gens, and under the empire it was un-
doubtedly the most extensive of all the Roman houseS.

5. otio luxurioso esse] Sub coepit, i. q. erat, ‘⁶ debauched
in his intervals of leisure.'' The gross (lebauchery imputed to
Sulla (but we must remember how many enemies he had made)
is painted in strong colours by Plutarch in his life. He was

said to have died of a loathsome disease brought on, we may
suppose, by intemperance.

6. Nisi quod] Complete the sentence thus: nisi hnic
laudi repuynat quod. Comp. Tac. Αηη. 1. 33, ipsa Agrippina
paulo commotior, nisi quod castitate...indomitum animum in
bonum trahebat, i.e. quae res non poterat non damnosa fieri
