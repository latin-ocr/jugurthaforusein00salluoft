NOTES. 133

12. Quasi permixtio terrae] “Like an earthquakess’ in
which the strata of the soil are thrown into confusion ancl
change places. The boldness of the illustration is acknow-

ledgeffl by the word quasi, ‘as it xx ere.’

CHAPTER XLII.

V 1. majores] Tib. and C. Gracchus were grandsons on the
mother’s side of P. Scipio Africanus major, the conqueror oi

Hannibal. See Plutarch, Tib. Gracch. 1.

2. vindicare...ln ubertatem] “To claim freedom for the
people :'’ the legal phrase ior the declaration before the praetor
of a slave's manumission. Vindicare may stand by itself. Liv.
iii. 46, ita vindicatur Virginia spondentibus propinquis.

3. Spes societatis] Scil. the hope of being conjoined with
the nobility in the enjoyment of magistracies, provincial govern-
ments, and other advantages.

4. Eadem] Neut. plur. “undertaking the same enterprise.”

mali exempli, a bad precedent. Comp. Tac. Anu. i. 35, saevum

9. Ferro aut ruga exstinxlt] The figure zeugma, where
one verb is coupled with two substantives though its sense
applies properly only to one. Thus euinque· ferro, “to be

extinyui fuya. Eat-stinguere (Gr. στίζω) “t-o prick or scratch
out.''

10. ulcisci] “To punishss' “to wreak vengeance φροη.Η
This· ιε the primax-y meaning of the word, to avenae (an' mjury,
a friend ‚') is secondary, and much less frequent. I⁴or the sense
of the passage compare Thucyd. iii. c2, πάντι δέ τρόπῳ, κ. τ. λ.

11. 81...pa.rem] ‘⁶ Π 1 should undertake.''
