as Sil. Ital. xii. 196, stat campus et arma, Et Mars in manibus,
and Lucan, vii. 253, In manibus vestris, quantus sit Caesar,
habetis, rather mean “ 111 your power to use.⁷’

CHAPTER LVIII.

1. Portam irrumpit] For in portam irr. This poetical
usage is affected by Sallust, comp. J uyur. 25; and imitated by
Tacitus (Anu. i. 483 ii. 62. Hist. i. 61; iii. 473 iv. 15, 50, etc).

2. Nominis Romani] “Of the fame of Rome.’' Comp.
Livy iv. 33, nominis Romani ac virtutis patrum vestraeque
memores. Lucan, viii. 798, Romanum nomen et omne Im·
perium Magno est tumuli modus.

3. Pauci in pluribus minus frustrati] “Being few in
number, and therefore sparse in array, while the enemy being
more numerous were more densely posted, they missed their
aim less frequently of the two. ” Fra-strati, passive.

4. Propere statim] “ Quickly immediately.'’ The
cavalry are sent speedily, Marius himself immediately, without
a moment's delay.

CHAPTER LIX.

1. In proximo] Scil. loco, “nearest to the enemy.’

2 quivissent.. .facerent] The imper rf. does not stand for
the plusq. perf„ but indicates that the slaughter was still
in progress wheh the Numidians had already been enabled to
maintain their ground. Comp. Florus, iii 3, 13, Cimbri si
statim infesto agmine urbem petissent, grande dis crimen esset:
i.e. the Cimbri did not attack the city immediately, and
accordingly the danger which was impending became averted.
Cic. Brut. 10, neque enim jam Troicis temporibus tantum
laudis in dicendo Ulixi tribuisset Homerus.. nisi jam tum
esset honos eloquentiae; i. c. great honour uas already paid

{rieloquegice at the time when Homer so praised Llysses.

3. Pedites cum equitibus permixti] Of this mode of
fighting among the Numidiam, we read in Auct. dc Bell. Afric.
69, Numidae...mirabili velocitate praediti, qui inter equites
pugnabant. Caesar himself introduced this practice into his
own legions.

4. victos dare] i. q. vincere: an antique or poetical usage.
It occurs frequently in Plautus. Comp. Liv. mi. 6, sic stratas
legiones Latinorum dabo. Virg. Aen. xii. 437, nunc te mea
dextera bello Defensum dabit. Aen. xi. 334, quando tot stragis
acervos Teucrorum tua dextra dedit. So also dicta dare for
dicere.
