Ν OTES. 163

aelv{{.„ Vos existimate] Emphatic: “judge ye for your-

24. Fortissimum quemque generosiss] Comp. Juvenal,
viii. 20, nobilitas sola est atque unica virtus.

25. vestros honores] ‘⁵ The honours you have to bestow.”

26. Ita hos petunt] “So seek the same,” i.e. your ho-
nours.

27. falsi sunt] “Are deceived.⁷'

28. Posteris lumen] Many MSS. read quasi himen,- and
this particle is frequently inserted, to soften the harshness of
a metaphor: as Cic. de Off. ii. 9, honestum decorumque quasi
perlucet ex iis quas commemoravi virtutibus,

29. In conscientiam duceret] “Construe into a consei-
ousness of guilt.'' Comp. above, ch. 82, 111 superbiam vertebant.
92, 111 virtutem trahebantur.

30. Ex animi mei sententia] The pmnoun, omitted in
many Mss„ seems to be required in solemn asseveratione of
this kind. Comp. Cic. cle Off. iii. 29, quod ex animi tui senten-
tia jurariS, sicut verbis concipitur more nostro, id non facere
perjurium est. And A. Gell. iv. 20, verba ita erant concepta ut
tu ex animi tui sententia uxorem habes,

31. Pidei causa] Scil. dandae, “ in confirmation of what Ι
say.'’

32. Hastam, vexillum, phaleras] The hasta was presented
to deserving soldiers (Festus in voc), and was called pura, as
having no iron head. The vexillum was a streamer at the end
of a spear: phalerae, trappings for horses: the alia clona mili-
taria were torques and catellae, chains, armillae, bracelets, fibu-
lae, claspS, coronae, crowns or chaplets of various kinds. Most
of these are enumerated among the trophies of Siccius Denta-
tus, by A. Gellius, ii. 11. Comp. Juvenal, xvi. ult„ laeti pha-
leris onmes et torquibus omnes

33. Neque literas Graecas didici] Plutarch, who has
made much use of this oration in describing the character of
Marius, repeats that 110 despised the manners and literature of
the Greeks on the account here mentioned, that they did not
save that people from conquest hythe Romans, and imputes
to this morose pride much of the barbarity of his actions. ὤσ-
περ οὕν Ξενοκράτει τῷ φιλοσόφῳ σκυθρωποτέρῳ δοκοῦντι τὸ ἦθος
εἶναι, πολλάκις εἰώθει λέγειν ὁ Πλάτων· ὥ μακάριε Ξενόκρατες θύε
ταῖς χάρισιν· οὕτως εἴ τις ἔπεισε Μάριον θύειν ταῖς Ἑλληνικαῖς
