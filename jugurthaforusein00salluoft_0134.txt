126 SALLUSTII JUGURTIIA.

CHAPTER XXXII.

1. captae] “ taken illegally.” Tac. Anu. iii. 67, saevitiae
captarumque pecuniarum teneri rcum.

2. arcessebant] ‘· Dcmanded for trial.” Tac. Ama. ii. 50,
arcessere majestatis. Suet. Claud. 37, arcessi statim ac mori
jussus est, “to bc tried and executcd.'‘

3. Permgas] Persuya seems strictly to mean “one who
seeks perfugium, refuge, by abandoning his post or party,”
transjuyu, “oue who deserts his own party and takes refuge
with anathem But uo such distinction is strictly observed.

4. 'ralis ea tempestate rama de Cassio erat] “Such at
that time was the estimation in which Cassius was held.”

CHAPTER XXXIII.

1. contra decus regium] “In a manner the reverse of
royal.” Comp. Tac. His-2. i. 82, contra decus imperii, ⁸· the
honour and glory oi legitimate authority.‘' Luc. vii. 588, ot*
Brutus, O decus imperii, spes O suprema senatus.

2. In vincula] ‘⁸ To prisou.”

3. Numidiae] Gen. for abl. Numidia, “in Numidia.”
The use of the genitive for the name of a country is stragulam
but. is here occasioned by the proximity οἱ the genitive oi a
city, Romae. In English we should say, at Rome, but in
Numidia.

4. corrupturum] “He would injure.‘’

CHAPTER XXXIV.

1. Quae ira fieri amat] “ Which anger delights to have
used.” Quintilian, iv. 3. 17, says: Graeca vero translata vel
Sallustii plurima, quale est vulgus amat fieri. This passage,
apparently corrupt, has been supposed to refer to that before
uS, and has been variously altered to apply to it. In Thucyd-
viii. 1, we find ὅπερ φιλεῖ δῆμος tectim and perhaps we should
read facere in Quintilian. The idiom φιλεῖ ’γίγνεσθαι is imitated
by late Latin writers, as Auson. ad Gratian. 1, ut apud Deum
fieri amat. Dictys, i. 3, sicut in re tali fieri amat; but this
usage is not found in better authors. Still less would the
Greek idiom of the verb sing. with the neuter plural be admis-
sible= In Juyur. 41, we read: scilicet ea quae res secundae
amant.
