with the Carthaginians about the year 540 of the city. Hc
entered into alliance with the Romans, but afterwards betrayed
them, and connected himself with his former enemies. After
various reverses he was finally defeated by the Romans. Po-
lybius asserts that he was led in Scipio's triumph, A. U. 553,
but Livy relates that he died in confinement previously Si-
lius Italicus follows Livy s account, and represents the effiqy

gg Othe captive as carried among oth'ers in the procession xvii.

Ante Syphax feretro residens captiva premebat
Lumina, et auratae servabant colla catenae...
Mox victas tendens Carthago ad sidera palmas
Ibat, et effiyies orae jam lenis iberae.

11. Magnum‘atque late] Both words are to be taken ad-

ceased only with his death.'’ At his decease the grants made
him by the Romans reverted to the repubhc, and his son Mi-
cipsa retained authority only in his patrimonial possessions.

of contemptuous abandonment.

CHAPTER VI.

1. Luxu] The dat. case. This use of u for ui is confined
according to Priscian, vii. 18, to poetry3 and adopted for the
convenience of metre. Julius Caesar, however, according to
Gellius, Noeta Atticae, iv, 16, considered it the true form of

the termination. In the MSS. of Sallust it occurs frequently,
but not always.
